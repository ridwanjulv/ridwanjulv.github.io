Hi there! 

I have been in the industry for almost 20 years. All this time I've learn a lot, but never tried to write and share. This year, I'd like to embark in a new chapter of my journey. Consider this post as my commitment to start writing and sharing my thoughts, my experience, and my lessons-learned.

As technology plays a significant role in my lifeâ€”both personally and professionallyâ€”my hope is that I can share a thing or two with you.

Iâ€™ll be the first to admit Iâ€™m not an expert, not even after all this year. Iâ€™m just a student, a curious learner, a normal person eager to learn new stuffs, and to share my experiences, insights, and discoveries along the way.

I hope you enjoy reading about my tech journey as much as I enjoy experiencing it.

See you soon on my next post ðŸ˜Š
